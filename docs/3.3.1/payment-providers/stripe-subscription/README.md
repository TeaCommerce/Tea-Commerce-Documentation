# Stripe Subscription

The Stripe Subscription provider allows the purchasing of Stripe Subscription plans. As such, it works in quite a specific way compared to other payment providers.

Where other providers simply pass payment details through to the payment gateway to be paid for, the Stripe Subscription provider passes through payment details along with Plan ID's that **MUST** match up with subscription plans setup in Stripe.

Because of this, when using the Stripe Subscription payment provider, it is assumed the Order contains **only** subscription plan order line items, and that each order line item's SKU (or an OrderLine property of "planId") matches a Plan ID within Stripe. Also, whilst a price will exist on the product page for displaying on the site, the actual price charged will come from the Stripe plan, so it's important that these are kept in sync.

Finally, because Tea Commerce's role is purely to facilitate the checkout process, the Stripe Subscription provider will simply setup the subscription and charge the initial fee. From then on, subsequent renewal payments will be handled soley via Stripe. If you want to trigger custom actions within Tea Commerce / Umbraco, for example to email a customer if a subscription payment fails, you should create a [Stripe webhook](https://stripe.com/docs/webhooks) to listen for relevant updates and trigger these actions manually.

## Configure Stripe

Login to the [Stripe dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/).

### Subscription Plans

To create a Subscription Plan, click **Billing** and **Product** from the left hand side menu. On the right hand side, click **Create Product**.

On the next screen, enter a **name** for the subscription plan and click **Create product**.

![stripe_006.png](/img/stripe_006.png)

On the next screen, fill in the details of the plan such as the recuring interval + pricing. Prices entered in Stripe should be exlcuding VAT as it is will be decided by Tea Commerce the relevant VAT Group and thus tax rate which applies. Once complete click **Add pricing plan**.

![stripe_007.png](/img/stripe_007.png)

**NB** If you chose not to set a plan ID manually, one will be created for you by Stripe. You should keep track of this as you'll need to store this against the product node within Umbraco.

Repeat the steps above for each subscription plan you wish to create.

### Live API Keys

Click **Developers** and then **API Keys** in the left hand side menu. On the right hand side you will find your **Publishable key**. To view your **Secret key**, click the **Reveal live key token**.

### Webhook Notifications

When the Stripe Subscription provider processes an order, it will create a subscription and initial invoice within Stripe. Because of how this works, it's not possible for the payment provider to be instantly notified that a transaction is captured.

In order for Tea Commerce to be notified of successfull initial payment, you need to register a webhook handler as follows. 

Click **Developers** and then **Webhooks** in the left hand side menu. On the right hand side, click **Add Endpoint** and enter the Tea Commerce cummunication URL as follows (replacing the parameters in square brackets with the corisponding values taken from your store):

`https://[domain]/base/TC/PaymentCommunicationWithoutOrderId/[storeId]/StripeSubscription%20-%20inline/[paymentMethodId]`

![stripe_003.png](/img/stripe_003.png)

You can leave **Filter events** set to all event types, or you can select just the **invoice** based event types. Click **Add endpoint** to add the endpoint.

**NB** You'll need to configure a webhook endpoint for both test and live configurations. To configure the test webhook, toggle the **View test data** toggle in the left hand side menu and then repeat the steps from above.

### Radar

The Stripe payment provider is automatically configured to send through billing contact information, this is in order for you to be able to perform validation rules using Stripe Radar. It is optional, but strongly recommended that you configure Radar Rules to validate the submitted Credit Card against these billing details. See the [Radar documentation](https://stripe.com/docs/radar/rules) for more details.

## Configure Tea Commerce

For the most part, the Stripe Subscription provider settings are similar to the regular Stripe provider however there is one important feature worth highlighting.

With the Stripe Subscription provider it is possible to configure it such that it can either capture payments right now, in which case a credit card checkout form will be presented at the payment stage, or you can actually configure it to send out invoices instead. This could be an attractive option for B2B where invoicing is the norm.

To conifgure this feature, you can use the **billing_mode** setting as documented in the table below.

**NB** If you would like to offer both options, credit card / invoice, you would need to setup two instances of the Stripe Subscription provider configured accordingly and then allow them to choose the relevant option at checkout.

### Provider Settings

Create a payment method and select **StripeSubscription - inline** as the payment provider. Now configure the settings as follows.

| Key | Description |
| --- | ----------- |
| form_url | The url of the page with the Stripe payment form on - e.g. /payment/ |
| continue_url | The url to navigate to after payment is processed - e.g. /confirmation/ | 
| cancel_url | The url to navigate to if the customer cancels the payment - e.g. /cancel/ | 
| billing_address_line1_property_alias | The alias of the property containing line 1 of the billing address - e.g. addressLine1. Used by Stripe for Radar verification. | 
| billing_address_line2_property_alias | The alias of the property containing line 2 of the billing address - e.g. addressLine2. Used by Stripe for Radar verification. |
| billing_city_property_alias | The alias of the property containing the billing address city - e.g. city. Used by Stripe for Radar verification. | 
| billing_state_property_alias | The alias of the property containing the billing address state - e.g. state. Used by Stripe for Radar verification. | 
| billing_zip_code_property_alias | The alias of the property containing the billing address zip code - e.g. zipCode. Used by Stripe for Radar verification. |
| test_secret_key | Your test stripe secret key. |
| test_public_key | Your test stripe public key. |
| live_secret_key | Your live stripe secret key. |
| live_public_key | Your live stripe public key. |
| mode | The mode of the provider - test/live. |
| billing_mode | Whether to charge payments instantly via credit card or to send out Stripe invoices - charge/invoice.. |

## Configure Umbraco

As mentioned in the section intro, with the Stripe Subscription provider we have to setup products in a specific way. When configuring your product we need to store and pass through the Stripe Subscription Plan ID to the checkout process. The simplest way to do this is to set the products SKU to be the Plan ID.

![stripe_009.png](/img/stripe_009.png)

If you need to set the SKU to something other than the Plan ID however, you can store the Plan ID in an alternative property and then pass this through on the OrderLine via property with the alias "planId".

The simplest way to do this would be to use an umbraco property with the alias "planId" and then configure [OrderLine Automatic Properies](../../api/order-line/#automatic-properties) to copy the "planId" field to the OrderLine properties collection. 

### Stripe Subscription Events

Working with subscriptions is somewhat different to working with standard products as the state of the subscription can change over time and so it is often desirable to know when these changes occur. To assist with this the Stripe Subscription payment provider will trigger events when certain state changes occur (so long as a valid [Webhook](#webhook-notifications) has been configured).

To listen for events you should register an event handler like so:

````csharp
public StripeSubscriptionEventHandler: ApplicationEventHandler
{
    protected override void ApplicationStarted(UmbracoApplicationBase umbracoApplication, ApplicationContext applicationContext)
    {
        StripeSubscription.StripeSubscriptionEvent += (sender, args) {
            // Handling logic goes here
        }
    }
}
````

The subscribed event handler will receive a `sender` argument, which is the instance of the StripeSubscription payment provider sending the event and an `args` argument which is an instance of the `StripeSubscriptionEventArgs` class.

The `StripeSubscriptionEventArgs` class contains the following properties:

| Name | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| Order | A copy of the Tea Commerce order this event relates to. |
| Subscription | An instance of the Stripe subscription object this event relates to. |
| Invoice | An instance of the Stripe invoice object this event relates to. Not all events have an invoice instance. |
| Type | The type of event being fired. Can be one of `SubscriptionCreated`, `SubscriptionStarted`, `SubscriptionRenewing`, `SubscriptionRenewed`, `SubscriptionPastDue`, `SubscriptionTrialEnding`, `SubscriptionUpdated` or `SubscriptionDeleted` |
