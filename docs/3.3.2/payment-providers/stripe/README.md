### Webhook Notifications

When using the Stripe provider, the status of an order is updated based on responses from Stripe sent over webhooks. Tea Commerce will automatically create and register a webhook communication URL with Stripe for you when you save the provider settings with valid API keys.

**NB** You need to register webhooks for both the *test* and *live* modes. Depending on which mode you have configured in the payment provider settings will determine which type of webhook registration is generated.

**TIP** If you need to test your webhooks locally, we recommend you use a tool such as [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) which can create a temporary public URL that safely proxies to your localhost server, allowing you to receive the Stripe webhook requests without the need to alter your firewall settings. When using such a tool, it may be necessary to alter the base URL of the communication URL generated by the provider. To do this, you can add a setting named **test_base_url** with the base URL you'd like to use instead and the communication URL will be generated based on this URL instead.

If you need to regenerate a webhook endpoint at any point, you should delete the existing webhook from within the Stripe dashboard and then re-save the payment provider to trigger the creation of a new one. 

If webhook generation is successful, 2 new payment provider settings will be generated:

* **test_webhook_id** The ID of the generated webhook
* **test_webhook_secret** The signing secret for validating webhook communications

If you don't see these settings generated, then something will have gone wrong with the generation process. Please review the sites log files for details.

### Radar

The Stripe payment provider is automatically configured to send through billing contact information, this is in order for you to be able to perform validation rules using Stripe Radar. It is optional, but strongly recommended that you configure Radar Rules to validate the submitted Credit Card against these billing details. See the [Radar documentation](https://stripe.com/docs/radar/rules) for more details.
